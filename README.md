Automatic Error Counter For Motocyclists
========================================

This app records errors/mistakes/things you wouldn't do again while you're riding. After the ride, you see how far you have driven and the number of errors you made.

Why?
----

Counting errors is a well-known technique in behaviour science to bring errors to mind and to remember them. By doing this, you're learning to drive better because you can (much better) remember the things you have done wrong/not quite right.

What is an error?
-----------------

An error is defined as "something you wouldn't do again" and can be anything from picking the wrong gear to catching yourself looking not far enough ahead. Just everything.

The number itself isn't so important. It's all about setting a stimulus to learn. The number is only a way to compare rides and see yourself improving over time.

How to record?
--------------

There can be serveral ways to record an error. For now, you're supposed to carry the phone in your jacket while riding and knock three times on its backside. The phone will vibrate and confirm thereby the error is counted. Unfortunately, as I discovered using multiple devices, some devices will slow down acceleration reporting when sleeping so this method isn't very reliable (or completely unavailable) then.

Another, probably more robust way could be using the button on your head phones.

Of course, using (special) buttons on the handle bars on bikes that support sending data to a smartphone would be preferable (but is yet not included in the first prototype).

This prototype does record only one ride and needs to be reset (by pressing a button in the app) for the next ride. In future versions there should be statistics to show all recorded rides to have a better overview of how (and maybe when) you improve (or degrade) over time (say at the start/end of the season, etc.).
