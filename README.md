Moto Score
==========

Tally counter for motorcyclists to record mistakes (i.e. everything you
wouldn't do again that way).

The prototype of this app was done and presented at [Hack The Ride][2].

After tinkering with a lot of ideas I decided to write something simple
I want myself.

How to use
----------

Moto Score is intended to be used with a __headset with a button__ on it.

Prepare the headset in a way that makes it very easy for you to press
the button __while__ riding.

Simply press the button to log a mistake. The phone will vibrate to confirm.

Keep the button pressed for a full second to signal start or end of a ride.

Moto Score will record the distance you've driven to calculate a mistakes per
km ratio.

Background
----------

Years ago, when I started riding motorcycles, I read
[The Upper Half of the Motorcycle][1] in which the author suggests
to record your mistakes to get aware of them.

By mistake he simply meant everything you wouldn't do again.
Picked the wrong gear? Mistake.
Catched yourself not looking far ahead? Mistake.
Overtook where you shouldn't have? Mistake.
You get the idea.

The thinking is, that the action of counting helps you to remember a
mistake which prevents you from doing it again.

Consciously counting mistakes stimulates learning.

So I got myself a small little counter that I could wear on a glove
and started counting. And while that worked for me a very long time,
I finally wanted to use my smart phone to keep history of my rides.
