Mistake Counter For Motocyclists
================================

Easily record mistakes (i.e. everything you wouldn't do again) while riding
and have a full history of your performance.

Limitations
-----------

You'll need some Android device and a __headset with a button__ on it.

Press the button to log a mistake. The Android will vibrate to confirm.

Of course, you should prepare the headset button in a way that makes it
very easy for you to press it __while__ riding.

  and start riding.
* Whenever you do something you wouldn't do again, press the button
  shortly.
* The app will automatically track how far you've ridden and show you
  gives you a rough idea of your performance that day by dividing
  the number of mistakes you made by the distance you drove.
* You'll have a full history of all your rides.

Background
----------

Years ago, when I started riding a motorcycle, I read
[The Upper Half of the Motorcycle][1] in which the author suggests
to record your mistakes to get aware of them.

A mistake, he said, is everything you wouldn't do again that way.
Picked the wrong gear? Mistake.
Catched yourself not looking far ahead? Mistake.
Overtook where you shouldn't have? Mistake.
You get the idea.

The thinking is, that the action of counting helps you to remember a
mistake which prevents you from doing it again.

So I got myself a small little counter that I could wear on my glove
and started counting. And while that worked for me a very long time,
I finally wanted to record my mistakes with my cellphone so I wouldn't
have to keep track manually.

I did this app for [Hack The Ride][2] 2014 in Barcelona.
