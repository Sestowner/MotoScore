you wouldn't do again like this).

The prototype of this app was written and presented at "Hack The Ride,"
a hackathon held by BMW Motorrad in Barcelona in 2014.

## How to use

Moto Score is intended to be used with a __headset with a button__ on it.

Prepare the headset in a way that makes it very easy for you to press
the button __while__ riding.

Keep the button pressed for a full second to signal start or end of a ride.
Your phone will vibrate for three seconds to confirm.

When riding, simply press the button to log a mistake.
Your phone will vibrate for a second to confirm.

Moto Score will record the distance you've driven to give you a reference
to compare rides.

## Background

Years ago, when I started riding motorcycles, I read
[The Upper Half of the Motorcycle][1] in which the author suggests
to record your mistakes to get aware of them.

By mistake he simply meant everything you wouldn't do again.
Picked the wrong gear? Mistake.
Catched yourself not looking far ahead? Mistake.
Overtook where you shouldn't have? Mistake.
You get the idea.

The thinking is, that the action of counting helps you to remember a
mistake which prevents you from doing it again.

Consciously counting mistakes stimulates learning.

So I got myself a small little counter that I could wear on a glove
and started counting. And while that worked for me a very long time,
I finally wanted to use my smart phone to keep history of my rides.

## Troubleshooting

### Tracking

The quality of tracking depends on the quality of your phone's GPS sensor.
Just try. If you can only get a bad resolution, you may want to change the
default values for GPS update requests in the settings. But be careful, the
more updates you request, the more battery you're using.
