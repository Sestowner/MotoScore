Moto Score
==========

A mistake tally counter for motorcyclists.

Easily record mistakes (i.e. everything you wouldn't do again that way)
while riding and have a full history of your performance.

Overview
--------

You'll need some Android device and a __headset with a button__ on it.

Press the button to log a mistake. Your phone will vibrate to confirm.

Of course, you should prepare the headset button in a way that makes it
very easy for you to press it __while__ riding.

How to use
----------

* Enable GPS.
* Plug in a headset and press the button on it for a second to signal the
  start of a ride.
* While riding, whenever you do something you wouldn't do again, press
  the headset button shortly.
* Moto Score will automatically track how far you've ridden to calculate
  a mistakes per km ratio. Please note that this ratio shall only give
  you a rough idea of your performance that day. The total number of
  mistakes actually doesn't matter that much. It's the process of
  counting that does matter.

Background
----------

Years ago, when I started riding motorcycles, I read
[The Upper Half of the Motorcycle][1] in which the author suggests
to record your mistakes to get aware of them.

A mistake, he said, is everything you wouldn't do again that way.
Picked the wrong gear? Mistake.
Catched yourself not looking far ahead? Mistake.
Overtook where you shouldn't have? Mistake.
You get the idea.

The thinking is, that the action of counting helps you to remember a
mistake which prevents you from doing it again.

So I got myself a small little counter that I could wear on my glove
and started counting. And while that worked for me a very long time,
I finally wanted to manage my recordings by cellphone so I wouldn't
have to do that manually.

The prototype of this app was done for [Hack The Ride][2] in Barcelona.
